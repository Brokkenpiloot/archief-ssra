# Archief SSRA

This repository is a **new project** for the Archief SSRA website. The final tech stack and hosting are not decided yet, so this repo focuses on:

- Project structure
- Content and UX direction
- Documentation and decisions

## Current status

- Static HTML/CSS prototype with login flow and archive navigation
- Supabase Auth wired for email/password sign-in (client-side)
- Specs and structure are tracked in `reference/`

## Next steps

- Finalize sitemap and content priorities
- Decide on stack and hosting when available
- Connect archive content and PDF data source

## Reference docs

See `reference/README.md` for the current documentation index.
