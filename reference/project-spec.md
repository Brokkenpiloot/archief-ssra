# Archief SSRA – Project spec (initial)

This document defines **initial conventions** for planning and documentation. The implementation stack is still undecided, so these rules focus on structure and clarity.

## 1. Documentation

- Keep documents short and practical.
- Prefer clear headings and bullet lists.
- Track decisions and constraints explicitly.

## 2. Structure

- Store reference docs in `reference/`.
- Keep the README concise and up to date.

## 3. Decisions

- When a decision is made (stack, hosting, CMS), add a short note to the relevant doc.
- Avoid assumptions; label unknowns as **TBD**.

## 4. Writing style

- Use simple, direct language.
- Avoid jargon unless necessary.
